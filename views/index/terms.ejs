      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of <strong>LinkPulse</strong>, a free <strong>URL shortener</strong> service provided by LinkPulse, Inc.

If you do not agree, please do not use our URL shortening tool.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">Using Our URL Shortener</h2>

        LinkPulse allows you to shorten URLs for free. You may use our service to create short links, generate QR codes, and track performance via analytics. You are responsible for the content you shorten and share. Do not use LinkPulse to:

      <h2 class="mb-3">Custom Domains and Features</h2>
      <p>
        Our free <strong>URL shortener</strong> offers <strong>custom domains</strong> to brand your links (e.g., yourbrand.com/abc123).
